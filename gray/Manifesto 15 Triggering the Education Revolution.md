十五条宣言之四

John Moravec 是一位世界公民，他将教育视为全球化和未来新的。他是Education Futures LLC的创始人，也是 *Knowmad Society*一书的著者，更是Invisible Learning计划的合作发起人，(暂未注入Markdown) I’ve met him on three occasions: Once in Germany, when we worked together on an advisory committee to help a new democratic school start up in Munich, and twice in the Netherlands in support of democratic education in Europe.

在2015年的第一天，正值许多人在新年之夕复苏的时候，Joht发来了一个文件，有着简单的名字——“十五条宣言”。We are at a time in history that is ripe for worldwide rethinking of, and rapid change in, education. Manifesto 15 can help promote that.

宣言的副标题乃是——「让学习进化」。进化，无论是生物上或是文化上的，都可以以两种方式发生。一种发源于已有系统中的渐进式改变，一种是来源于新系统中涌现并占据的新的利基， and thereby replace, the old ones. As I’ve argued [elsewhere](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201108/is-real-educational-reform-possible-if-so-how), I think the latter is how education must change and is already changing. Our current system of education is a dinosaur, unable to adapt.

我同意，至少它适用于教育层面，with the commenter on Manifesto 15 who, quoting Buckminster Fuller, wrote: "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete." I think the change that this manifesto will help trigger will consist of thousands of little revolutions occurring locally, in different ways in different places, all over the world. As you can see, below, John agrees.

我将重铸整个宣言在此，且第一条乃是：

John Moravec有关该宣言的评注

我曾经问过John有没有一些伴随十五条宣言重置版的评注，以下是他发给我的：

“该宣言倾向于以一种快照的形式呈现，它讲述了我们如何跟上时代学习并且去创造好的教育未来”It’s not meant to pretend to have all the answers or the best ideas, but it’s an honest assessment of where we’ve been, and, through a statement of principles, illustrate where we would like to go.

"该文的视角是全球化的，它是原则的启示，这也是为什么它不是一个明确的方针的原因。 I believe we need to attend to a diverse ecology of options rather than one master metanarrative for the future of education. And, if we are to create a diverse ecology of options, we need to build a lot more trust between ourselves, our communities, parents, students, governments, etc…. Item #12 speaks to this, I believe, and I think this point is super-important to emphasize.

"我发现并非所有都将同意该宣言，也许有些人会觉得它不完整。It is important to inspire as much conversation as possible. So, the document is licensed under Creative Commons, which gives (and encourages!) people to remix what we’ve written and share with their own communities.

“仅仅在一周内我就被该宣言所震惊了。我们有84个国家的读者。People—most of whom were strangers to me until now—are sending in completely unsolicited translations into local languages. As of this evening, it is available in seven languages, and at least another six are in progress.”

"我从未想象过这个计划竟然会如此被广泛接受。Again, this is just a statement of principles and not a plan for action. However, we might have just ignited a movement. It’s time to engage in a big conversation around our next steps.”

既然如此，下面就奉上此宣言：
